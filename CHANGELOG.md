#  Voltage Change Log

## 2018-08-23 - v0.1.0

This is the first alpha release of Voltage. I've been working on this project when I've
had free time over the past six months. It's now to a point where I feel comfortable
releasing a binary so that I can get some feedback regarding the socket
connection process. I'm also trying to figure out if I have the code-signing,
sandboxing and entitlements configured correctly. Once all that stuff is worked
out, it should be relatively easy to deploy additional features.
